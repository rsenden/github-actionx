## fortify/github-action

The primary `fortify/github-action` action currently allows for running SAST scans on either Fortify on Demand or ScanCentral SAST.  Which activities to perform is controlled through action inputs, the input for those activities is provided through environment variables. With Fortify on Demand, software composition analysis of open source components may also be performed in conjunction with the SAST scan for customers who have purchased the functionality.

### Action inputs

**`sast-scan`** - OPTIONAL    
When set to true, the action will run a SAST scan on either Fortify on Demand (if the `FOD_URL` environment variable has been specified), or on ScanCentral SAST (if the `SSC_URL` environment variable has been specified). This includes packaging the source code, running the scan, and optionally reporting SAST scan results back into GitHub. 

If not specified or when set to false, no SAST scan will be performed. For now, this means that the action will complete without doing any work. Future versions of this action may provide additional inputs, for example allowing you to run a dynamic application security testing (DAST) scan instead of a SAST scan.

### Action environment variable inputs

#### Fortify on Demand


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->

**`FOD_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com

Required when authenticating with user credentials: FoD tenant, user and password. It's recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
Extra FoD login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli fod session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-fod-session-login.html)

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->

**`FOD_RELEASE`** - OPTIONAL    
Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric release id, `<app-name>:<release-name>` (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices applications). Default value is [`<github.action_repository>:<github.action_ref>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL     
By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip` to package application source code. The `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable can be used to specify additional packaging options. 

If FoD Software Composition Analysis has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, you'll need to pass the `-oss` option through this environment variable to generate and package the additional dependency files required. 

Based on the  automated build tool detection feature provided by ScanCentral Client, this default `scancentral` command is often sufficient to properly package application source code. Depending on your build setup, you may however need to configure the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable to specify additional packaging options. 

As an example, if the build file that you want to use for packaging doesn't adhere  to common naming conventions, you can configure the `-bf <custom build file>` option using the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable. See [Command-line options for the package command]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url#CLI.htm#Package}}) for more information on available options.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

<a name="fortify-github-action-setup"></a>

## fortify/github-action/setup


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-setup.md -->

This action allows for setting up the Fortify tools listed below. Which tools and which versions to install, and whether to add the tool bin-directories to the system path, is controlled through action inputs as listed in the next section.

* [fcli](https://github.com/fortify/fcli)
* [ScanCentral Client](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/2320/SC_SAST_Help_23.2.0/index.htm#A_Clients.htm)
* [FoDUploader](https://github.com/fod-dev/fod-uploader-java)
* [FortifyVulnerabilityExporter](https://github.com/fortify/FortifyVulnerabilityExporter)
* [FortifyBugTrackerUtility](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility)

### Action inputs

**`export-path`** - OPTIONAL    
Whether to add the installed tools to the system PATH variable. Allowed values: `true` (default) or `false`

**`fcli`** - OPTIONAL    
The fcli version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install fcli), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.0` and `2.0.0` are semantically the same.

**`sc-client`** - OPTIONAL    
The ScanCentral Client version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `23.1` will install the latest known `23.1.y` patch version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v23.1` and `23.1` are semantically the same.

**`fod-uploader`** - OPTIONAL    
The FoDUploader version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v5` will install the latest known `5.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v5.4.0` and `5.4.0` are semantically the same.

**`vuln-exporter`** - OPTIONAL    
The FortifyVulnerabilityExporter version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.4` and `2.0.4` are semantically the same.

**`bugtracker-utility`** - OPTIONAL    
The FortifyBugTrackerUtility version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v4` will install the latest known `4.x` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v4.12` and `4.12` are semantically the same.

### Action outputs

For each tool being installed, the action outputs several environment variables for use by later workflow steps.

**`PATH`**    
If the `export-path` action input was set to `true` (default), the bin-directory of the installed tool will be added to the workflow `PATH` environment variable.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_INSTALL_DIR`**    
Directory where the corresponding tool was installed. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_INSTALL_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_BIN_DIR`**    
Bin-directory that holds the executables for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_BIN_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_CMD`**    
Fully qualified path to the (primary) executable/script for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_CMD`.

### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for installing the various Fortify tools and how to run these tools. Some notes:

* The `export-path` and `bugtracker-utility` inputs are set to their default values, and thus could have been omitted.
* The action supports semantic versioning, so the `vuln-exporter` input will install the latest known v2.x.y version of FortifyVulnerabilityExporter.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Setup Fortify tools
        uses: fortify/github-action/setup@v1
        with:
          export-path: true
          fcli: latest
          sc-client: 23.1.0
          fod-uploader: latest
          vuln-exporter: v2
          bugtracker-utility: skip
      - name: Run fcli from PATH
        run: fcli -V
      - name: Run fcli using FCLI_CMD environment variable
        run: ${FCLI_CMD} -V

<a name="fortify-github-action-fod-sast-scan"></a>

## fortify/github-action/fod-sast-scan


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-fod-sast-scan.md -->

This action performs a SAST scan on Fortify on Demand (FoD). If software composition analysis of open source has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, this action can be used to perform a combined SAST and SCA (open source) scan. 

The SAST and optional open source scan performed by this action consists of the following steps:

* Login to FoD
* Package application source code using ScanCentral Client
* Submit the source code package to be scanned to FoD
* Optionally wait for the scan to complete
* Optionally export scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard

Before running this action, please ensure that the appropriate release has been created on FoD and has been configured for SAST scans. Future versions of this action may add support for automating app/release creation and scan setup. If open source scanning has been enabled in the FoD SAST scan configuration, be sure to pass the `-oss` option through the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable.

Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->

**`FOD_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com

**`FOD_CLIENT_ID` & `FOD_CLIENT_SECRET`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with an API key: FoD Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).

**`FOD_TENANT`, `FOD_USER` & `FOD_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with user credentials: FoD tenant, user and password. It's recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->

**`FOD_RELEASE`** - OPTIONAL    
Fortify on Demand release to use with this action.

Default value is [`<github.action_repository>:<github.action_ref>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->


### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for exporting FoD SAST vulnerability data to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Export FoD vulnerability data to GitHub
        uses: fortify/github-action/fod-export@v1
        env:
          FOD_URL: https://ams.fortify.com
          FOD_TENANT: ${{secrets.FOD_TENANT}}
          FOD_USER: ${{secrets.FOD_USER}}
          FOD_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.FOD_PAT}}
          # FOD_RELEASE: MyApp:MyRelease
```

<a name="fortify-github-action-sc-sast-scan"></a>

## fortify/github-action/sc-sast-scan


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-sc-sast-scan.md -->

This action performs a SAST scan on ScanCentral SAST, consisting of the following steps:

* Login to ScanCentral SAST Controller
* Package application source code using ScanCentral Client
* Submit the source code package to be scanned to ScanCentral SAST Controller
* Optionally wait for the scan to complete
* Optionally export scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard

Before running this action, please ensure that the appropriate application version has been created on SSC. Future versions of this action may add support for automating application version creation.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/

**`SSC_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a `CIToken`.

**`SSC_USER` & `SSC_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->


**`SC_SAST_CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED    
Required: ScanCentral SAST Client Authentication Token for authenticating with ScanCentral SAST Controller.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli sc-sast session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-session-login.html).

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->

**`SSC_APPVERSION`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric application version id, or by providing application and version name in the format `<app-name>:<version-name>`. Default value is [`<github.action_repository>:<github.action_ref>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip` to package application source code. Based on the  automated build tool detection feature provided by ScanCentral Client, this default `scancentral` command is often sufficient. Depending on your build setup, you may however need to configure the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable to specify additional packaging options. 

As an example, if the build file that you want to use for packaging doesn't adhere  to common naming conventions, you can configure the `-bf <custom build file>` option using the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable. See [Command-line options for the package command]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url#CLI.htm#Package}}) for more information on available options.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->


**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST scan options; see [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->
