<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-fod-sast-scan.md -->

This action performs a SAST scan on Fortify on Demand (FoD). If software composition analysis of open source has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, this action can be used to perform a combined SAST and SCA (open source) scan. 

The SAST and optional open source scan performed by this action consists of the following steps:

* Login to FoD
* Package application source code using ScanCentral Client
* Submit the source code package to be scanned to FoD
* Optionally wait for the scan to complete
* Optionally export scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard

Before running this action, please ensure that the appropriate release has been created on FoD and has been configured for SAST scans. Future versions of this action may add support for automating app/release creation and scan setup. If open source scanning has been enabled in the FoD SAST scan configuration, be sure to pass the `-oss` option through the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->

**`FOD_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com

**`FOD_CLIENT_ID` & `FOD_CLIENT_SECRET`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with an API key: FoD Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).

**`FOD_TENANT`, `FOD_USER` & `FOD_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with user credentials: FoD tenant, user and password. It's recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
Extra FoD login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli fod session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-fod-session-login.html)

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->

**`FOD_RELEASE`** - OPTIONAL    
Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric release id, `<app-name>:<release-name>` (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices applications). Default value is [`<github.action_repository>:<github.action_ref>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL     
By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip` to package application source code. The `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable can be used to specify additional packaging options. 

If FoD Software Composition Analysis has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, you'll need to pass the `-oss` option through this environment variable to generate and package the additional dependency files required. 

Based on the  automated build tool detection feature provided by ScanCentral Client, this default `scancentral` command is often sufficient to properly package application source code. Depending on your build setup, you may however need to configure the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable to specify additional packaging options. 

As an example, if the build file that you want to use for packaging doesn't adhere  to common naming conventions, you can configure the `-bf <custom build file>` option using the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable. See [Command-line options for the package command]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url#CLI.htm#Package}}) for more information on available options.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra FoD SAST scan options; see [`fcli fod sast-scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-fod-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for running a SAST scan on FoD.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Check out source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  
      - name: Run FoD SAST Scan
        uses: fortify/github-action/fod-sast-scan@v1
        env:
          FOD_URL: https://ams.fortify.com
          FOD_TENANT: ${{secrets.FOD_TENANT}}
          FOD_USER: ${{secrets.FOD_USER}}
          FOD_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.FOD_PAT}}
          # EXTRA_FOD_LOGIN_OPTS: --socket-timeout=60s
          # FOD_RELEASE: MyApp:MyRelease
          # EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS: -oss
          # DO_WAIT: true
          # DO_EXPORT: true
```
